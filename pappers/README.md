## Agents
- Authors: Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow and Vladimir Vuskovic
- This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent.

## Attention Is All You Need
- Authors: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin
- In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.

## The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking
- Authors: Microsoft
- The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in knowledge workflows raises questions about its impact on critical thinking skills and practices. We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so.

## Which Economic Tasks are Performed with AI? Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations
- Authors: Anthropic
- Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence’s impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy.

## AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery
- Authors: Google
- In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing critical pieces of computational infrastructure.
