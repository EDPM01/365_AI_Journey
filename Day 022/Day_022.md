Read this papper about The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking

The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in knowledge workflows raises
questions about its impact on critical thinking skills and practices.
We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and
how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using
GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so.
Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work
tasks
